# ReCo Project ReadMe
In collaboration with Jack Kinney.

**Concert Recommendation**: *"ReCo"*
   - This is a service-type website in which the userâ€™s Spotify listening history (through top artists) is utilized to recommend a concert/event for an artist. This is done primarily through connecting Spotify and Ticketmaster's API.

## How to Run

### Requirements
- You must have an active Spotify account.
- To use this website and Spotify + Ticketmaster API calls, **I need to grant you access** by adding your account (your Spotify account email) to our allowed users on the Spotify API dashboard.
- Please feel free to contact me if you have any issues with this part.
